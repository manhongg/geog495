The final project is a major component of this course. Each student is expected to develop a web gis application. Your final projects are expected to be published online, and the codes are expected to be shared on GitHub in order to contribute to both the open-source community and academia. The final project must satisfy the following items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.

- the template of your web map should be any of the templates that we introduced in Week 7 - 11. If you are willing to do something else, please contact the Instructor to approve your request.

- You application will have base map and thematic map layers. 
    - You will need to design your own style of base map.
    - The thematic layer(s) must to be hosted in the github repository as geojson data. 

- You need to create a `readme.md` file and save it in the root of the final project repository. In the repository, please describe the web map. Your description needs to include, but not limited to, the following items: 
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - The application URL (not the repository url)
    - Screenshots
    - Main functions
    - Data sources
    - Applied libraries (e.g., mapbox gl js) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use

## 2\. Online Presentation

Please create a `new discussion` post to share your project to your classmate in the discussion board at our course repository. In the post you created, please share the content of the readme.me file for your final project. Please get it done by **Thursday (Dec 8th by 11:59pm)**.
